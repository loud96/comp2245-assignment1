        <h2>Louetta Daly</h2>
        <p>I'm passionate about web development because it allows me to combine 
            my love for technology with my creativity. As an IT professional pursuing 
            a degree in Data Science, I've always been fascinated by the power 
            of data and how it can drive decision-making. Web development provides 
            me with the canvas to build interactive and user-friendly experiences that can make a real impact.
